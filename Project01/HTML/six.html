			<p>SUNDAY:</p>
			
			<p>I finally arrived at my all time favorite coffee shop after 30 minutes. I opened the door and the shopkeeper's bell rang.</p>
			</br>
			
			<p>I walked over to the counter and I greeted the cashier. I felt like getting a latte. I asked the barista if she could do some cool latte art.</p>

			<h2>What design should I get?</h2>

			<a href="../HTML/seven.html">(1) I show the barista an Instagram post, telling her that was what I wanted.</a>
			</br></br></br>
			
			<a href="../HTML/fourteen.html">(2) I told her surprise me.</a>
